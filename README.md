# Rugby Scraper

Simple Python application designed to scrape Wikipedia websites for URC and PREM rugby leagues and format the data as `.json` output files.

This project is simple but it is my first exposure to web-scraping and my first attempt to automate a task that I would otherwise consider completing by hand.

The code is simple and it will likely be extended to extract data from Top14 league and the PWR, as, although not designed to handle these leagues, the design of the code means that the data can be extracted.

This tool is designed to be used with my other, larger project, Rugby Game (current WIP)
